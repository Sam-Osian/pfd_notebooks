Thistlethwaite,Rutland and North Leicestershire,The Secretary of State for Health and Social Care,"On 31st May 2024 I commenced an investigation into the death of Anne Towlson aged 58. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 10th February 2025. The conclusion of the inquest was that the cause of Mrs Towlson's death was unascertained at post-mortem, however, on the balance of probabilities her death was caused or contributed to by the cosmetic surgery that she underwent in Instanbul, Turkey, in the weeks before death.","Mrs Towlson was a 58 year old female who was found dead at her home address on seventeenth May two thousand and twenty four. Mrs Towlson travelled to Turkey on twenty fourth April two thousand and twenty four where she underwent a pre-planned tummy tuck and liposuction. On arrival at the hospital she was told she could have an arm tuck surgery as well and she opted to undergo that at the same time, this was said to be a ""last minute decision"". Mrs Towlson's arm wounds did not heal like the wound to her tummy did when she was found dead it was noted that she had open wounds to her armpits and triceps and her right arm was ""swollen and weeping"".","I am concerned about the fact that the inquest was unable to secure any information from the Turkish hospital. We have no information about whether any independent enquiries were made either by the company who organised Mrs Towlson's trip to Turkey for surgery, or the Turkish hospital itself as to whether Mrs Towlson was fit for surgery. We have not been able to secure her medical records so have no understanding of what exactly the surgery consisted of, or what post-operative care and treatment was provided to Mrs Towlson. I am concerned about the fact that we have no evidence to confirm whether Mrs Towlson was made aware of the risks and mortality rates associated with any of the surgical procedures she underwent in Turkey. I am concerned about the fact that Mrs Towlson had travelled to Turkey to have a tummy tuck and liposuction but was offered additional arm tuck surgery when she arrived at the hospital. I have concerns about the consenting process for this additional surgery as, on the balance of probabilities, Mrs Towlson was not given enough time to properly consider this decision. Whilst I appreciate the UK Government has no control over what happens abroad, I am concerned about the fact that British citizens are travelling abroad for significant and serious surgical operations with seemingly little in the way of follow up and no way to return easily to the operating hospital if they encounter complications once they are back in the UK. This is not only dangerous but could place a significant burden on the NHS.",Anne Towlson,58,tummy tuck; liposuction; arm tuck surgery,"Death caused or contributed to by the cosmetic surgery that she underwent in Instanbul, Turkey, in the weeks before death.","we have no evidence to confirm whether Mrs Towlson was made aware of the risks and mortality rates associated with any of the surgical procedures she underwent in Turkey; I have concerns about the consenting process for this additional surgery as, on the balance of probabilities, Mrs Towlson was not given enough time to properly consider this decision.",<NA>,<NA>,<NA>,no way to return easily to the operating hospital if they encounter complications once they are back in the UK,Mrs Towlson travelled to Turkey on twenty fourth April two thousand and twenty four where she underwent a pre-planned tummy tuck and liposuction; British citizens are travelling abroad for significant and serious surgical operations with seemingly little in the way of follow up and no way to return easily to the operating hospital if they encounter complications once they are back in the UK.

The cause of death was unascertained, but it was likely related to the recent surgery, particularly as her arm wounds had not healed and were found open and infected. The inquest was unable to obtain any information or medical records from the Turkish hospital, leaving uncertainty about her fitness for surgery, the procedures performed, and the post-operative care provided. There was no evidence that Mrs Towlson was informed of the risks or mortality rates, and concerns were raised about the adequacy of the consent process for the additional arm surgery, which was a last-minute decision. The report highlights concerns about British citizens travelling abroad for major surgery with insufficient follow-up and the potential burden on the NHS if complications arise after their return."
517,https://www.judiciary.uk/prevention-of-future-death-reports/gillian-stokes-prevention-of-future-deaths-report/,2024-0436,2024-08-08,K. Hayes,Surrey,Secretary of State for Health & Social Care; President of the Royal College of Radiologists; Chief Executive of the Royal College of Nurses; Medical Director of Ashford & St Peters Trust Medical,"On 15 June 2023, I commenced an investigation into the death of Mrs Gillian Patricia Stokes. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 8 July 2024. The conclusion of the inquest was on 2 June 2023, Mrs Gillian Patricia Stokes died at the age of 74 years old from sarcoma of the right chest wall at Woking & Sam Beare Hospice, Woking. Sarcoma is a known complication of life-saving historic radiotherapy treatment for previous breast cancer in 2013.","Mrs Stokes died of radiation induced sarcoma, which originated in the chest wall. She had a history of breast cancer confirmed in a referral by Woking and Sam Beare Hospice. Nine months prior to her death, Mrs Stokes had an investigation into pain in her right breast. She first attended her GP on twenty-sixth October who referred her to a Breast Clinic at Ashford Hospital. The radiation induced sarcoma was not found on an ultrasound on tenth November two thousand and twenty-two. She attended a Breast Clinic, and her symptoms were investigated, which was said by the hospital clinicians to be in line with National Guidelines of symptomatic symptoms of patients with breast implants with suspected ALCL (Anaplastic large cell lymphoma). The guidance given on investigations does not include what investigations need to be carried out on patients with a history of radiation with an implant to ensure the entirety of the chest wall is checked for masses. Furthermore, there is no guidance for clinicians to consider the rare diagnosis of radiation induced sarcoma, which is said by specialists at the Royal Marsden to be a growing issue, due to the increasing use of radiation combined with reconstructive surgery in the form of implants. Mrs Stokes was first diagnosed with breast cancer in two thousand and thirteen and was given chemotherapy and radiotherapy treatments, which included radiation of the chest wall. She also had a mastectomy followed by reconstructive surgery which included a breast implant. Between two thousand and thirteen and two thousand and eighteen she returned to the Breast Clinic at Ashford Hospital on several occasions, as she was unhappy with the implant. She had complained that it had been positioned too high, was misshapen and too large. She had a breast reduction and a further operation to remove some of the scar tissue and excess skin. Due to the multiple operations she continued to have soft tissue scarring and it remained uncomfortable, but she decided not to have any further surgery. Mrs Stokes had five years of surveillance scanning following her breast cancer diagnosis in case the breast cancer should reoccur. The latency period for radiation induced sarcoma can be up to ten years. She had an MRI scan on seventh August two thousand and twenty-two to investigate other issues unrelated to the breast cancer, the scan covered the area where the cancer was later found, but at that time no mass was present. In October two thousand and twenty-two, she reported to her GP surgery that she had a swelling in her breast area, which resulted in pain around her breast, down her right arm and armpit. She was referred to the Breast Clinic at Ashford via her GP. As recommended in National Guidelines, the patient underwent a triple assessment for symptomatic breast disease. The triple assessment consists of clinical examination, imaging and biopsy of any abnormal finding. Mrs Stokes was seen at the Breast Clinic within the two-week period of an urgent referral. At the Breast Clinic, Mrs Stokes initial clinical examination was conducted by a Nurse Diagnostician. The Nurse confirmed in evidence that her examination of Mrs Stokes chest wall was limited by her breast implant. If she had not had a breast implant, she would have been able to palpate the mastectomy area and rub it. This was not possible due to the implant. Mrs Stokes was referred for a mammogram on her left breast, as cancer can often appear in the other breast following first diagnosis of breast cancer. This was clear. She was also referred for an ultrasound of her right breast, this was in line with the national guidance called ABS Best Practice Diagnostic Guidelines Symptomatic Breast. The concern by all three clinicians following Mrs Stokes presentation at One Stop Clinic, following the clinical examination by the Nurse, an ultrasound by the Radiologist and the Surgeon, was that Mrs Stokes may have an issue regarding ALCL (Anaplastic large cell lymphoma â€“ a fast and rare growing cancer). This was because liquid was found surrounding the breast implant. Some fluid was taken for testing and no malignant cells or markers of ALCL were found. This is in accordance with the Royal College of Radiologists Guidance on screening and symptomatic breast imaging fourth edition, breast specialists must be aware of the possibility of this rare complication of implant breast augmentation. Radiation induced sarcoma was not considered as a possible diagnosis, as the cases that the Nurse, Radiologist and the Surgeon have experienced present with focal mass or skin change, clinically with a focal mass abnormality associated on imaging which was not found on ultrasound with Mrs Stokes. In evidence and confirmed at the inquest, the radiologist who carried out the examination in November two thousand and twenty-two confirmed that the examination normally should include examination of the skin down to the chest wall which lies posterior to the implant for focal masses. In Mrs Stokes case, the position of the implant meant that the radiologist could not see posteriorly to the breast implant with ultrasound imaging, as the image cannot go beyond the implant and therefore not down to the chest wall. The radiologist confirmed that she could see the surface of the implant and around the implant, where there was a moderate amount of fluid, but no mass in the breast tissue and no nodularity related to the surface of the implant. There was therefore in the clinicians view no suspicion of a sarcoma because no mass was visible on the surface of the breast tissue or around the implant. The implant capsule demonstrated a smooth contour with no irregularity or nodule surrounding the implant. I asked both the Nurse and the Radiologist if the fact that they could not carry out a full examination down to the chest wall was raised at MDT when deciding what management steps to take next. I was advised it was not, as it was not a consideration that there was a focal mass behind the implant. The patient wanted the implant out and she had not tested positive for ALCL. At inquest, I was told by the surgeon that they could not MRI all patients who were in this position. Furthermore, they confirmed that the guidance did not require them to. Whereas there is specific guidance for ALCL cases which are also very rare in number but can be tested by a cytology test by taking a sample of fluid. In written evidence doctors from the Royal Marsden, who considered Mrs Stokes case at MDT after the sarcoma was diagnosed, wrote in written evidence that sarcomas are very fast growing and it is evident in this case that Mrs Stokes was as it was not present in the MRI in August two thousand and twenty-two. I had further written witness evidence from a colleague of the Radiologist from Ashford Hospital who advised whilst they were unable to see anything on ultrasound to suggest a focal mass was present in November two thousand and twenty-two, given the size of the mass on twenty-seventh January two thousand and twenty-three, there is a possibility that it may have been present if an MRI scan was used in November two thousand and twenty-three, but it is impossible to say. Royal Marsden also advised that it was not possible to say. After the One Stop Clinic following the aspiration the Nurse advised in evidence Mrs Stokes should have had a further review after two weeks, as indicated in the paperwork, but this was not followed through by the hospital and the message was not clearly communicated to the family. This would have allowed for further follow up in case the bulge had increased in size and in pain, but Mrs Stokes was not seen again until January two thousand and twenty-three, as she was reclassed as a cosmetic case following the negative ALCL tests. Mrs Stokes attended again for an operation on twenty-sixth January two thousand and twenty-three and the staging CT scan on fifteenth March two thousand and twenty-three her sarcoma was classed as inoperable by Royal Marsden. Mrs Stokes was treated palliatively and passed away on second June two thousand and twenty-four.","I am concerned that there is not any or insufficient guidance available to clinicians in regard to possible radiation induced sarcoma or first line investigations for patients with breast implants to be able to see down to the chest wall. The Radiologist, Surgeon and Nurse advised that they did not have any specific guidance in relation to possible radiation induced sarcoma. Radiation induced sarcomas are increasing in incidence as more primary breast cancer patients are now offered breast conserving surgery with wide local excision and radiotherapy rather than mastectomy alone. Therefore, in his view the increasing use of radiotherapy leads to increased number of patients developing radiation induced sarcomas. Diagnosis requires the treating clinician to recognise that this is a possibility. Furthermore, the difficulties in diagnosis are that they are sometimes not recognised by primary and secondary care teams who are the first to see the patient. The Radiologist confirmed that the Royal College of Radiologists do not have a protocol for patients who have had previous radiotherapy and implant. Furthermore, Nurse Diagnostician confirmed there was no protocol in the ABS Best Practice Diagnostic Guidelines for radiation induced sarcoma where a patient has had an implant. I have a concern regarding the current surveillance period of five years provided to patients with breast cancer considering the latency period of radiation induced sarcoma is ten years. I have concerns regarding the system in place at Ashford Hospital for two week follow ups following an aspiration following an initial assessment at the One Stop Clinic. Following the aspiration Mrs Stokes received, the Nurse advised in evidence Mrs Stokes should have had a further review after two weeks as indicated in the paperwork but this was not followed through by the hospital and the message was not clearly communicated to the family. This would have allowed for further follow up in case the bulge had increased in size and in pain and could have potentially identified the need to investigate further.",Mrs Gillian Patricia Stokes,74,mastectomy followed by reconstructive surgery which included a breast implant; breast reduction; removal of scar tissue and excess skin,sarcoma of the right chest wall (radiation induced sarcoma),<NA>,<NA>,<NA>,insufficient guidance for clinicians regarding radiation induced sarcoma and first line investigations for patients with breast implants; no protocol for patients with previous radiotherapy and implant; current surveillance period may be too short given latency of sarcoma,lack of follow-up after aspiration; failure to communicate need for review to family; missed opportunity for further investigation,<NA>,"Mrs Gillian Patricia Stokes died from radiation-induced sarcoma of the right chest wall, a rare complication following radiotherapy and reconstructive surgery with a breast implant after breast cancer treatment in 2013. Nine months before her death, she reported pain and swelling in her right breast and was referred to the Breast Clinic at Ashford Hospital. Standard triple assessment investigations, including ultrasound, did not detect the sarcoma, partly because the breast implant limited both physical examination and imaging of the chest wall. The clinical focus was on ruling out ALCL, and there was no consideration or guidance for diagnosing radiation-induced sarcoma in such cases. The absence of specific protocols for investigating possible sarcoma in patients with prior radiotherapy and implants, and the inability of ultrasound to visualise behind the implant, contributed to the delayed diagnosis. A recommended two-week follow-up after aspiration was not arranged, and communication with the family was inadequate. The report raises concerns about insufficient clinical guidance for detecting radiation-induced sarcoma in similar patients, the lack of protocols for imaging the chest wall in the presence of implants, the adequacy of the five-year surveillance period given the ten-year latency of sarcoma, and failures in follow-up systems at Ashford Hospital."

Lake,Norfolk,The Secretary of State for Health and Social Care The Rt Hon Steve Barclay MP; The Department of Health and Social Care,On 9 December 2019 I commenced an investigation into the death of Melissa Hannah Kerr aged 31. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 12 September 2023.,"Melissa Kerr was admitted to Private Medicana Kadikoy Hospital, Istanbul on nineteenth November two thousand and nineteen and underwent surgery to harvest fat from the abdomen, thighs and the jowl area of her face. Ms Kerr was not seen by a surgeon or clinician prior to the nineteenth November two thousand and nineteen. Evidence revealed that Ms Kerr underwent a limited assessment prior to the procedures. The evidence is that Ms Kerr was provided with limited information regarding the risks and mortality rate associated with the procedures. The fat was collected and processed before it was injected into her buttocks; a liposuction procedure and a Brazilian Buttock Lift procedure. During surgery Ms Kerr became unwell. Her condition deteriorated and she was declared dead. There is limited documentary evidence as to the procedures performed. Expert evidence was heard that certain techniques used during the Brazilian Buttock Lift procedure increased the risk of fat embolus occurring, namely the choice of access incision for the augmentation cannula and the decision to inject fat into the superficial muscle.",Expert evidence was heard that the findings in this case are consistent with findings in other cases where patients have died following autologous fat transfer to the gluteal area during an operation colloquially known as Brazilian Buttock Lift. I understand from the evidence heard that due to the high mortality associated with this procedure a voluntary moratorium on the practice of this procedure has been introduced in the UK. Recommendations for safer practices have emerged that recommend significant changes to practice. I am concerned that patients travelling to Turkey for this procedure are not being made aware of the risks and the high mortality rate associated with this surgery. I am also concerned that patients are travelling abroad where there are no or limited controls with regard to such surgery taking place. Evidence was heard there Ms Kerr was not seen by a surgeon before the date of the procedure. There was limited psychological and physical assessment prior to the procedure proceeding. I appreciate the UK Government has no control over what happens abroad. However I am concerned that citizens are travelling abroad for such procedures unaware of the risks involved and that practices are used which are regarded as unsafe in the UK.,Melissa Hannah Kerr,31,liposuction; Brazilian Buttock Lift; autologous fat transfer to the gluteal area,fat embolus during Brazilian Buttock Lift procedure,Ms Kerr was provided with limited information regarding the risks and mortality rate associated with the procedures.,patients are travelling abroad where there are no or limited controls with regard to such surgery taking place.,patients travelling to Turkey for this procedure are not being made aware of the risks and the high mortality rate associated with this surgery; citizens are travelling abroad for such procedures unaware of the risks involved,<NA>,<NA>,patients travelling to Turkey for this procedure; patients are travelling abroad; citizens are travelling abroad for such procedures,"Melissa Kerr, aged 31, died following a liposuction and Brazilian Buttock Lift procedure at a private hospital in Istanbul. She was not seen by a surgeon or clinician before the day of surgery and underwent only a limited assessment. She received insufficient information about the risks and mortality rates associated with the procedures. During surgery, she became unwell and died, with expert evidence indicating that certain surgical techniques used increased the risk of fat embolism. The case reflects similar findings in other deaths following this type of surgery, which has a high mortality rate and is subject to a voluntary moratorium in the UK. There are concerns that UK citizens travelling abroad for such procedures are not adequately informed of the risks and may be exposed to unsafe practices not permitted in the UK."

Hassell,Inner North London,Chief Executive Phoenix Hospital Group,"On 6 October 2020, I commenced an investigation into the death of Paula Speirs, aged 77 years. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 25 February 2021. I made a narrative determination at inquest, a copy of which I now attach.","Paula Speirs died from the ingestion of benzodiazepines that were not prescribed for her, which she had taken in an attempt to deal with anxiety before she underwent submental recontouring and a mini face lift on twenty-fifth August two thousand and twenty at Weymouth Street Hospital.","When Ms Speirs arrived at Weymouth Street Hospital early on the morning of her procedure, staff formed the view that she was intoxicated. Her surgeon and anaesthetist agreed that, as a consequence of this, they could not be sure that she consented to the procedure. Very properly, they cancelled it for that day. Ms Speirs was allowed to use her room to sleep off her intoxication. Her husband was informed of the cancellation and told that he would be telephoned when she awoke, so that he could then come to collect her. However, in spite of her intoxication at seven am from what was at the time an unknown substance, initially presumed to be alcohol, no formal observations were ordered or undertaken. Her room was easily accessible, but nobody was specifically tasked with monitoring her. No instructions were given as to how frequently she should be checked, or what that checking should involve. The nurses looking after Ms Speirs were not given any instructions on how to avoid positional asphyxia. When I asked them about this at inquest, they explained that they had not previously heard of positional asphyxia. I have encountered positional asphyxia most frequently in a custodial setting. Detainees in police cells are now subject to very clearly laid down procedures that attempt to reduce the risk of positional asphyxia and to reduce drink and drug related deaths. It seems to me an omission that there is not a similar regime in a hospital, where one would expect the medical care to be of a higher standard.",Paula Speirs,77,submental recontouring and a mini face lift,ingestion of benzodiazepines that were not prescribed for her,"Her surgeon and anaesthetist agreed that, as a consequence of this, they could not be sure that she consented to the procedure.

She was allowed to rest in her room, with her husband informed of the situation, but no formal monitoring or observations were arranged despite her intoxicated state. No specific staff member was assigned to monitor her, and no guidance was given on the frequency or nature of checks, nor on preventing positional asphyxia. Nurses were unfamiliar with positional asphyxia, a risk more commonly addressed in custodial settings, and there was a lack of hospital procedures to mitigate such risks, representing a significant omission in patient care."

Bennett,Birmingham and Solihull,"British Association of Aesthetic & Plastic Surgeons; British Association of Plastic, Reconstructive & Aesthetic Surgeons; National Institute for Care Excellence",On 10th September 2019 I commenced an investigation into the death of Renee Simone Brooks. The investigation concluded at the end of an inquest on 14th January 2020. The conclusion of the inquest was that she died from a recognised but rare complication fat embolism syndrome of a necessary procedure contributed to by pre-existing cardiac issues.,"Mrs Brooks had debilitating lipoedema from the waist down and in her upper limbs, causing significant mobility impairment and pain. Her BMI was 46.1. She underwent rehabilitation and functional liposuction procedures in June, July and August 2018 and January 2019. These procedures were uneventful, she recovered well, and benefited from an improvement in her quality of life. On 29th August 2019 she underwent what was intended to be the final procedure on her legs. The risks, including fat embolism syndrome, were considered and consented to. The risk of mortality was considered low. The procedure took about 4 hours and was performed as planned. At the end of the procedure she suddenly went into cardiac arrest and after about 7 minutes was resuscitated and taken to Birmingham Heartlands Hospital. She remained very poorly and despite maximum treatment died on 30th August 2019. Post-mortem tests revealed she had a pre-existing significantly enlarged heart and fat embolisms were found in her lungs.","Large volume liposuction is the recognised treatment for patients with lipoedema performed by a small number of specialist surgeons. UK guidance is limited to cosmetic procedures. There are no UK guidelines for lipoedema related liposuction and practices amongst surgeons vary considerably. I heard evidence from consultant plastic and reconstruction surgeon, Spireâ€™s Group Clinical Director, and investigation lead for Spire Parkway Hospital. All expressed concern about the absence of UK guidance relating to indications for safe practice. In particular, in relation to: (a) the frequency of procedures on a single patient, (b) the amount of fluid to put into the patient during the procedure, (c) the amount of fluid to remove from the patient during the procedure, and (d) the post procedure patient recovery plan. Spire Group have since the death of Mrs Brooks created their own internal standard guidance. The majority of procedures are performed on privately paying patients, although the NHS will refer a small number of patients for the procedure funded by the NHS.

There are no national guidelines on safe practice for lipoedema-related liposuction, leading to significant variation in surgical practice, including frequency of procedures, fluid management, and recovery plans. Spire Group has since created internal guidance, but the lack of national standards poses ongoing risks to patient safety and may result in future deaths if not addressed."

McLoughlin,West Yorkshire,"Joseph Hill, Solicitors; The Secretary of State for Health, Mr Mathew Hancock; The General Medical Council",On 5 September 2018 an investigation was commenced into the death of Leah Louise Cambridge aged 29. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 22 November 2019. The conclusion of the inquest was a narrative. The medical cause of death was adipose tissue fat embolism cosmetic surgical procedure,"Leah L Cambridge aged 29 travelled to Izmir Turkey to undergo a cosmetic surgical procedure under general anaesthetic, known as a Brazilian Butt Lift (BBL). The surgery commenced on Monday 27th August 2018 some 90 minutes after she was admitted to the hospital at 08:17 hours. The BBL entailed harvesting fat from her stomach using liposuction and then reinserting the fat once purified into her buttocks and thighs using a cannula. A complication arose during the procedure resulting in her being pronounced dead at approximately 13:00 hours the same day. A post mortem examination carried out in England revealed some fat had entered veins in her body leading to a fat embolism, which then caused her death.",Notwithstanding the death of Ms Cambridge on 27 August 2018 and concerns expressed in relation to the risks involved in BBL procedures by a task force established under the auspices of the Aesthetic Surgery Education and Research Foundation ASERF and a voluntary moratorium declared by the British Association of Aesthetic and Plastic Surgeons BAAPS the Inquest heard evidence that some plastic surgeons in the UK continue to carry out BBL procedures. Furthermore that Elite Aftercare continue to facilitate other clients to travel to Turkey for the purpose of BBL procedures to be undertaken by surgeons such as [REDACTED]. I am concerned at the lack of intervention and control of BBL procedures by the regulatory authorities in the UK. In order to make an informed decision as to the wisdom of undertaking effective cosmetic surgical procedures such as BBL it is important that the person involved receive adequate information regarding the mortality and morbidity risks involved. In order to read and absorb such information it needs to be provided prior to any commitment being made or expense incurred. The Inquest into the death of Ms Cambridge heard that she was provided with a substantial quantity of material some of which was written in Turkish on the morning of the surgery and required to sign each page. The Inquest found she had insufficient time to digest this complex material even if she was in a frame of mind to try shortly before being taken to theatre.

Despite warnings from professional bodies and a voluntary moratorium by BAAPS, some UK surgeons continue to perform BBLs, and companies still facilitate travel abroad for such procedures. The inquest raised concerns about inadequate regulation and lack of control over BBL procedures in the UK. It was found that Ms Cambridge was not given sufficient time or accessible information to provide informed consent, as crucial material was presented in Turkish and only shortly before surgery. The report highlights the need for regulatory authorities to ensure proper guidance on surgical techniques and to mandate that comprehensive risk information is provided to patients well in advance of any commitment or expense."
